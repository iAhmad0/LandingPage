## **Project Description**

This project is about designing a 'Landing Page', in which a lot of modern functionalities exist, such as 'Scroll to Top', 'Scroll to Section', and 'Dynamic styling and positioning of newly added elements'.  
The scroll behavior is ***smooth*** and the active section is ***highlighted***.

## **Demo Image**

## **Usage**

To test the 'Landing Page', click on the nav bar items and the viewport should scroll smoothly to the ***clicked*** section name.  
Also, the 'Scroll to Top' button should appear slightly before ***Section 2*** is activated.
